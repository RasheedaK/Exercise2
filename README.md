Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).<br/>
Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.<br />
The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).<br />
The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).<br />
Given a DNA strand, it is transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:<br />
G -> C<br />
C -> G<br />
T -> A<br />
A -> U<br />
